  <p>Thank you for using Weebly’s application programming interfaces (the “Weebly APIs”). By accessing and using the Weebly APIs, including using the Weebly APIs through a third-party product that accesses Weebly, you agree to Weebly’s API Terms of Use below (the “API Terms”).  You must have a valid agreement already in place with Weebly, including but not limited to a Weebly Cloud Agreement or Weebly Marketplace Agreement (“Partner Agreement”), which grants you access to the Weebly APIs.  If you disagree with any of these API Terms, Weebly does not grant you a license to use the Weebly APIs. We reserve the right to update and change these API Terms from time to time without notice.  If you are agreeing to these API Terms for use of the Weebly Services by an organization, you are agreeing to these API Terms on behalf of the organization. You must have the authority to bind that organization to these API Terms, otherwise you must not sign up for the Weebly Services.  In these API Terms, “you” and “your” will refer to you, or your organization that is agreeing to these terms, while “we” refers to Weebly.</p>

<h2 id="1-licensed-uses-and-restrictions">1. Licensed Uses and Restrictions.</h2>

<p>The Weebly APIs are owned by Weebly and are licensed to you on a worldwide (except as limited below), non-exclusive, and revocable basis on the terms and conditions set forth herein. You shall not transfer or sub-license any rights granted by these API Terms, except as necessary for merchants and customers to use your Weebly API Apps, if applicable.  These API Terms define the legal use of the Weebly APIs, including all updates, revisions, substitutions, and any copies of the Weebly APIs made by us or by you.  All information, data, text, software, music, photographs, graphics, video, messages, goods, products, services or other materials posted by Weebly users on their web sites (“User Content”) via Weebly’s website creation service (the “Weebly Services”) are owned by the users and not by Weebly.  All rights not expressly granted to you are reserved by Weebly.</p>

<p>A “Weebly API App” is any software application, website or other interface that you develop, own or operate to interact with the Weebly APIs.  Any use of Weebly APIs must comply with the Weebly policies and requirements set forth on the Weebly API websites or other documentation provided by Weebly, which may be modified from time to time.  You may need to apply to gain access to certain features of the Weebly APIs, or move your Weebly API Apps into production, and Weebly may deny those requests, or revoke access, if we believe you are in violation of these API Terms or if we think your use of the Weebly APIs adversely affects our users.  You may not use anything that Weebly provides for any purpose not related to the Weebly Services.</p>

<h3 id="you-shall">You shall:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Comply with your current Partner Agreement, the Weebly Terms of Service at <a href="http://www.weebly.com/terms-of-service/">http://www.weebly.com/terms-of-service/</a> and Weebly’s Privacy Policy at: <a href="http://www.weebly.com/privacy/">http://www.weebly.com/privacy/</a>.</li>
  <li>Comply with any requirements or restrictions imposed on usage of User Content by their respective owners. Remember, Weebly doesn’t own User Content - Weebly users do. Although the Weebly APIs can be used to provide you with access to User Content, neither Weebly’s provision of the Weebly APIs to you nor your use of the Weebly APIs, override User Content owners’ requirements and restrictions, including any terms and conditions that may be agreed upon between you and the owners.  In ALL cases, you are solely responsible for securing clear, express consent from the user to retrieve their information and access User Content.</li>
  <li>Ensure that all materials, including software and documents that you provide to Weebly, are checked with Internet industry standard up-to-date antivirus and anti-worm software, and determine them to be virus-free and worm-free.  Any data provided to Weebly must not contain harmful scripts or code.</li>
  <li>Ensure that your networks, operating system and software of its web server(s), routers, databases, and computer systems (“Systems”) are properly configured to Internet industry standards, as required to securely operate your products and services. If you do not completely control any aspect of the System, you will use all control or influence that you have over such Systems and/or selection of Systems, and you will not architect or select Systems in a manner to avoid the foregoing obligation. An example of an unacceptable server is one that operates as open proxy. An example of architecting in an unacceptable manner would be if you select a server operated by a vendor with substandard security practices, so that you could contend that you do not control such server, in order to avoid having to select an acceptable server.</li>
  <li>Promptly report any security deficiencies in or intrusions to your Systems that you discover to Weebly in writing via email to security@weebly.com. You will work with Weebly to immediately correct any security deficiency and will disconnect immediately any intrusions or intruder.  In the event of any such security deficiency or intrusion, you will make no public statements (i.e. press, blogs, bulletin boards, etc.) without prior written and express permission from Weebly in each instance.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="you-shall-not">You shall not:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Use the Weebly APIs for any application that replicates or attempts to replace the essential user experience of Weebly.com or any Weebly applications.</li>
  <li>Reverse engineer Weebly websites, or any individual element of Weebly websites, or the layout and design of any page or form contained on a page, without Weebly’s written consent.</li>
  <li>Mislead, confuse or surprise users.  For example, your Weebly API App should be transparent with users about what it does – you must obtain a user’s explicit consent to (i) modify that user’s account settings, data, or device, (ii) disclose, distribute or sell any User Content, or (iii) attempt to get any rights to any User Content.</li>
  <li>Use, make copies of, or store User Content or other data of user’s customers except as explicitly permitted by user.  You must delete all copies of User Content and data when they are no longer required for the purpose for which they were created.  You are prohibited from using User Content or any other data of user’s customers for competitive benchmarking or other similar or related purposes.</li>
  <li>Attempt to cloak or conceal your identity or your application’s identity when requesting authorization to use Weebly APIs.</li>
  <li>Use the Weebly APIs for any products or services  that constitute, promote or are used in connection with spyware, adware, or any other malicious programs or code.</li>
  <li>Violate any law or regulation, or any rights of any person, including but not limited to intellectual property rights, rights of privacy, or rights of personality.</li>
  <li>Use Weebly as a generic image hosting service for banner advertisements, graphics, etc.</li>
  <li>Use the Weebly APIs in a manner that adversely impacts the stability of Weebly.com servers or adversely impacts the behavior of other applications using the Weebly APIs. Further, we reserve the right to rate limit or block applications that make a large number of calls to the API that are not primarily in response to direct user actions.</li>
  <li>Sell, lease, or sublicense the Weebly APIs or access thereto or derive revenues from the use or provision of the Weebly APIs, whether for direct commercial or monetary gain or otherwise, except as set forth in Section 1.</li>
</ul>

<p>You represent and warrant that:  (a) all information you have provided to Weebly is true, accurate, and complete; (b) you have not previously had any type of Weebly account which has been terminated by Weebly (or have made us aware of that in connection with your current application); (c) you have the full right, power and authority to make, distribute, operate, support, and promote your products and services, use the Weebly APIs, and to enter into these API Terms; and (d) your use of the Weebly APIs will not violate the intellectual property rights or other rights of others, or violate any laws.</p>

If you are a California resident, you waive your rights under California Civil Code 1542, which states, “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.” You understand that any fact relating to any matter covered by this release may be found to be other than now believed to be true and you accept and assume the risk of such possible differences in fact.

Weebly shall use good faith efforts to provide you with written notice of such claim, suit or action. Weebly will be entitled, at our expense, to participate in the defense and settlement of the claim or action with counsel of our choosing.  You may not settle any claims that limit our rights without our prior consent (which will not be unreasonably withheld).</p>

<h2 id="12-general-terms">12. General Terms</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Relationship of the Parties</strong>:  Notwithstanding any provision hereof, for all purposes of the API Terms, you and Weebly shall act independently and not as partner, joint venturer, agent, employee or employer of the other. You shall not have any authority to assume or create any obligation for or on behalf of Weebly, express or implied, and you shall not attempt to bind Weebly to any contract.  These API Terms also create no third party beneficiary  rights.</li>
  <li><strong>Assignment</strong>:  You may not assign any of your rights in these API Terms, and any such attempt is void, but Weebly may assign this contract, in whole or in part, at any time with or without notice to you.</li>
  <li><strong>Invalidity of Specific Terms</strong>:  If any provision of the API Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision and that the other provisions remain in full force and effect.</li>
  <li><strong>Modification</strong>:  We may revise these API Terms from time to time and the most current version will always be posted on our website. Other changes may be posted to our blog or terms page, so please check those pages regularly. By continuing to access or use the Weebly APIs after revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised API Terms.

All claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the services or software must be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of San Francisco county, California, except you agree that Weebly may apply for injunctive relief in any jurisdiction.  You and Weebly consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there.</li>
  <li><strong>No Waiver of Rights by Weebly</strong>: Weebly’s failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the API Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the API Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible.</li>
  <li><strong>Miscellaneous</strong>: The section headings and subheadings contained in these API Terms are included for convenience only, and shall not limit or otherwise affect the terms of these API Terms. Any construction or interpretation to be made of these API Terms shall not be construed against the drafter.  Your current Partner Agreement, the API Terms (along with any licenses to the Weebly APIs), Weebly’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, constitute the entire and exclusive agreement between you and Weebly with respect to the Weebly APIs, and supersede and replace any prior or contemporaneous agreements, terms, and conditions applicable to the Weebly APIs.</li>
